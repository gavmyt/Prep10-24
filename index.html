<p>1. Correlation is used to describe the relationship of two variables if the relationship of those two variables is linear</p>
<p>2. Correlation is for describing the relationship between two different variables, while causation is showing that one variable
caused the other </p>
<p>3. Three different ways to show relationships are scatter plot matrixes, parallel coordinates plots, and locally weighted scatter
plot smoothing. Parallel coordinates plots can show any type of data, whether it is categorical or quantitative, while scatter
plot matrixes are only quantitative. Locally weighted scatter plots, on the other hand, are also quantitative, but it is moreso a way
to make certain data more accurate by weighting certain things to even out the data and make it easier to understand when comparing
those points of data.
